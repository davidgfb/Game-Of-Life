It's a simulation of the 'Game Of Life', a zero players game created by John Conway.

The app is written in JS, HTML, and CSS. It uses the framework ELECTRON.js

To run this app you need NPM. First you must download/clone this repository and then execute 'npm start' on the directory where
you downloaded the files.

I hope you enjoy it!
